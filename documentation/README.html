<title>An ISO 'C' (1994) compliant runtime library for the Amiga</title>
<body>

<h1>An ISO 'C' (1994) compliant runtime library for the Amiga</h1>

<h2>1. What is this?</h2>

<p>This is my attempt to get Samba 2.2.x ported to the Amiga. My first Amiga
port required SAS/C and a number of strange tricks had to be pulled to get
it to support the kind of environment Samba needed. But with the
introduction of Samba 2.2.x many of those tricks did not work any more,
which is why I decided to attack the problem at the root, namely the
runtime library.</p>

<p>Because it was no longer possible to build Samba with SAS/C on the new
Amiga platform, the idea came up to move development to the GNU 'C'
compiler. This turned out to be a challenge due to its somewhat
underdeveloped runtime library and header files. Eventually, I decided to
rewrite that library from scratch.</p>


<h2>2. What does it do?</h2>

<p>Using <i>'C' - A reference manual</i> (4th edition) as a reference I wrote a set of
header files, then proceeded to implement each single function referenced in
them. With few exceptions in the area of wide character support, the result
should be a feature complete implementation of the ISO 'C' (1994) runtime
library.</p>

<p>Because Samba needs a few POSIX-like routines to be supported, the library
functionality is complemented by a set of routines described in <i>Advanced
programming in the Unix environent</i>.</p>

<p>This is not a portable implementation of the library in the sense that you
could move it from one 'C' compiler on one operating system to another.
This is an Amiga specific implementation.</p>

<p>The library supports floating point math, which, for the 68k platform, is
limited to IEEE single and double precision or M68881 inline math. There is no
support for the fast floating point (FFP) format or exclusive IEEE single
precision. You either get double precision (IEEE math) or extended precision
(M68881 inline math). What it is that you get is determined at compile time.
Use the <tt>IEEE_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORT</tt> preprocessor symbol to activate IEEE math
code and the <tt>M68881_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORT</tt> symbol for M68881 inline math.</p>

<p>For the PowerPC platform, the library uses code borrowed from fdlibm 5.3,
which is a portable library of arithmetic functions developed by Sun
Microsystems which, for example, is also used within the Java platform.</p>

<p>Not unlike SAS/C, you can configure a minimum stack size the program is to use
when it starts up. This is controlled via the <tt>__stack_size</tt> variable (see
<tt>stdlib_main.c</tt>).</p>

<p>I added some <tt>amiga.lib</tt> and <tt>debug.lib</tt> functionality to the library, but don't
count on it to be complete.</p>

<h3>2.1 Thread-safety</h3>

<p>The library code is supposed to be thread-safe if built with the <tt>__THREAD_SAFE</tt>
preprocesssor symbold defined. Note that 'thread-safe' does <em>not</em> mean
'reentrant'. Multiple callers for certain library functions are permitted, but
not for all of them. For example, <tt>mkdtemp()</tt> is not thread-safe, and neither is
<tt>rand()</tt> or <tt>localtime()</tt>. But as per <b>POSIX 1003.1c-1995</b> there are thread-safe
variants of <tt>rand()</tt> and <tt>localtime()</tt> called <tt>rand_r()</tt>, <tt>localtime_r()</tt>, and others.
The use of the socket I/O functions is still problematic because the
underlying <tt>bsdsocket.library</tt> API is not supposed to be used by any process
other than the one that opened it. Also yet unsolved is the issue of reading
error codes from the <tt>errno</tt> variable which currently always contains the
error code left by the last caller.</p>


<h2>3. What does it not do?</h2>

<p>This library is a departure from the typical 'C' runtime environments of the
past which had to run on all AmigaOS releases, down to Kickstart 1.1. This
very library was designed to take advantage of the routines available since
Kickstart 2.04 was introduced and virtually nobody ever put to use. This helps
to cut the code size, and it also helps to keep bugs out of the library by
falling back onto well-tested implementations. However, the catch is that the
code won't run under Kickstart 1.3 and below. But then these operating system
releases have been obsolete for more than a decade, and you can always go back
to a compiler environment which supports them.</p>

<p>There is very little support for <tt>amiga.lib</tt> functionality. There is <tt>NewList()</tt>,
<tt>HookEntry()</tt>, <tt>CallHook()</tt>, <tt>CallHookA()</tt>, the <tt>DoMethod()</tt> family, the RexxVars
family, but that's all. If you need more, you would have to implement it
yourself. Put another way, if you absolutely need functionality that is only
found in <tt>amiga.lib</tt>, you really shouldn't need in in the first place.</p>


<h2>4. Where does the source code come from?</h2>

<p>I originally thought that it might be helpful to piece this library together
from various sources, such as the BSD libc. Turned out that this code was so
'portable' that it became much more complex than it ought to be. Also, some
side-effects were present which considerably changed the behaviour of the
library. For example, the BSD libc uses <tt>bcopy()</tt> as an alias for <tt>memcpy()</tt>, and
unlike <tt>memcpy()</tt> is documented to, <tt>bcopy()</tt> supports overlapping copies.</p>

<p>Eventually, I wrote virtually all the code myself, borrowing algorithmic ideas
from the BSD libc and the Manx Aztec 'C' runtime library. Because I don't know
much about the environment GCC expects, I borrowed code snippets from libnix,
which was written by Matthias Fleischer and Gunther Nikl. This in particular
concerns the integer and floating point math support, the <tt>setjmp</tt>/<tt>longjmp</tt>
routines and the startup code. The M68881 inline math code comes from the
<tt>&lt;math-68881.h&gt;</tt> file written by Matthew Self <tt>(self@bayes.arc.nasa.gov)</tt>.</p>


<h2>5. Limitations and caveats</h2>

<p>There is hardly any documentation on the code I wrote. In part this is due to
the fact that the code itself is very simple in design. It should speak for
itself. However, to make a usable runtime library you have to have a user
documentation as in man pages or autodocs. We will eventually have to have
autodocs for this library.</p>

<p>The code is currently plastered with assertions and debug code. It is
therefore much larger than it ought to be and runs much slower than it ought
to be. For example, the <tt>malloc()</tt> routine will set the contents of the memory
allocated to a 'dirty' bit pattern which is likely to break software which
makes assumptions about its contents. Likewise, the <tt>free()</tt> routine will trash
the memory to deallocate with a different 'dirty' bit pattern to turn up reuse
of memory after deallocation. All these debugging features can be disabled by
defining the <tt>NDEBUG</tt> preprocessor symbol at compile time (see <tt>&lt;assert.h&gt;</tt>).</p>

<p>The exception handling in the math code is not particularly effective. For one
part this is due to the fact that there is no exception handler installed by
the runtime library when it starts up which could catch and process the error
conditions the CPU or FPU generates. The idea was to provide for a portable
runtime library with little to no assembly language involved. To make the
exception handling complete, such code would be necessary.</p>

<p>The library currently builds under SAS/C, but because the 'normal' program
startup code is not utilized, the base relative (A4) addressing does not work.
If you are going to test it, use the <tt>data=faronly</tt> option to compile the
library and the programs.</p>

<p>Different build makefiles are supplied for use with GCC. There is
<tt>GNUmakefile.68k</tt> for the 68k platform and <tt>GNUmakefile.os4</tt> for the AmigaOS4
PowerPC version.</p>

<h3>5.1 Floating point math and functions (<tt>scanf()</tt>, <tt>printf()</tt>, etc.) </h3>

<p>The plain <tt>libc.a</tt>, which your software would be linked against by default, does not contain
any floating point support code. This means, for example, that <tt>printf("%f",...)</tt> will not produce
the desired output and that <tt>scanf("%f",...)</tt> may not read any data at all. If your
program needs functions such as these or <tt>atod()</tt> then you must link against <tt>libm.a</tt> or
the equivalent.</p>

<p>To link the floating point support code with your software, use the <tt>-lm</tt> compiler option. Careful!
The order in which you specify the libraries to link against is important here. Thus, <tt>gcc -o test test.c -lm -lc</tt>
would correctly link the program <tt>test</tt> against the proper floating point math library, but
<tt>gcc -o test test.c -lc -lm</tt> would not.</p>

<h3>5.2 The thread-safe library</h3>

<p>Thread-safety does not imply that you can have multiple callers
access and close the same file. There is no resource tracking to that degree
yet. All that the thread-safety tries to afford you is not to get into big trouble
if simultaneous and overlapping accesses to files, memory allocation and other
resources are taking place.</p>

<p> Also take care with file I/O involving the <tt>stdin</tt>/<tt>stdout</tt>/<tt>stderr</tt>
streams; read/write operations on these streams will be mapped to the <tt>Input()</tt>/</tt>Output()</tt>/<tt>ErrorOutput()</tt>
file handles of the process performing these operations. Since only this small set of
operations is mapped, functions such as <tt>fcntl()</tt> or <tt>select()</tt> will not
work on the <tt>stdin</tt>/<tt>stdout</tt>/<tt>stderr</tt> streams and the corresponding
file descriptors <tt>STDIN_FILENO</tt>/<tt>STDOUT_FILENO</tt>/<tt>STDERR_FILENO</tt>.
It is therefore strongly recommended to use the thread-safe library only for applications
which can cope with the limitations described above.</p>



<h2>6. Conventions and design issues</h2>

<p>You will have noticed the 330+ files in this directory. This is not the best
way to organize a runtime library, but at least all the bits and pieces are in
plain sight. Each file stands for the one or two routines it contains. The
name indicates what routine(s) that might be. Each file name is prefixed by
the name of the header file in which the corresponding routine is defined. So,
for example, you will find that <tt>unistd_lchown.c</tt> contains the definition of
the <tt>lchown()</tt> routine, which has its prototype defined in the <tt>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</tt> header
file.</p>

<p>Internal function and variables which need to be visible across several
modules have names prefixed with two underscores, as in <tt>__stdio_init()</tt>.</p>

<p>All routines attempt to do error checking on their parameters. They will
either drop into an <tt>assert()</tt> or set an errno value and refuse to go any
further. This cuts performance but should help to catch the simple bugs quite
easily (<tt>NULL</tt> pointers).</p>

<p>Just like any halfway sane Amiga 'C' runtime library, this one performs its <tt>^C</tt>
checking in the I/O routines. Typically once upon entry and in every iteration
of the loop there might be it will quickly poll the <tt>^C</tt> signal and drop into
<tt>raise(SIGINT)</tt> in case the signal is set. This is just about the safest method
to solve the problem and should be much more robust than the ixemul approach
of 'interrupt anywhere - crash anywhere' using the task switch/launch hooks to
test for signals.</p>

<p>By default all library routines follow the ISO 'C' conventions in that where
implementation defined behaviour is permitted, the AmigaOS rules are followed.
For example, <tt>unlink()</tt> will by default operate like <tt>DeleteFile()</tt> and <tt>rename()</tt>
will return with an error code set if the name of the file/directory to be
renamed would collide with an existing directory entry. However, your program
can set a global variable <tt>__unix_semantics</tt> which will cause some routines to
perform like their Unix counterparts. This is necessary for Samba to work but
not a generally desirable feature. You have some Unix-like behaviour, but the
environment itself is not completely Unix- or POSIX-compliant. And it
shouldn't be. Don't make the mistake of trying to mold the environment into a
POSIX emulation. It doesn't work; AmigaOS is not Unix.</p>


<h2>7. The startup code</h2>

<p>There are three program startup files provided. The most simplistic is in
<tt>startup.c</tt> which I use for SAS/C. It just invokes the setup routine which
eventually calls <tt>main()</tt> and drops straight into <tt>exit()</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>ncrt0.S</tt> file was adapted from the libnix startup code which sets up the
base relative data area, if necessary (the <tt>SMALL_DATA</tt> preprocessor symbol must
be defined).</p>

<p>The <tt>nrcrt0.S</tt> file was adapted from libnix startup code, too, and sets up the
base relative data area for programs to be made resident. Note that the
<tt>geta4()</tt> stub is missing here; it wouldn't work in a resident program anyway.</p>

<p>The <tt>ncrt0.S</tt> and <tt>nrcrt0.S</tt> files are considerably smaller and less complex than
the libnix code they are based on. This is because in this library design all
the more complex tasks are performed in the <tt>stdlib_main.c</tt> file rather than in
assembly language.</p>


<h2>8. Documentation</h2>

<p>Well, you're reading it. There isn't anything much yet. You can consult the book
<i>'C' - A reference manual</i> and you could look at the
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975">Open Group's Single Unix
Specification</a>.</p>


<h2>9. Legal status</h2>

<p>Because this library is in part based upon free software it would be
uncourteous not to make it free software itself. The BSD license would
probably be appropriate here.</p>

<p>The PowerPC math library is based in part on work by Sun Microsystems:</p>
