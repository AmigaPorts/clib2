In order to build the library, you need a 'C' compiler (obvious, isn't it?) and
a set of header files for the networking API definitions. The networking header
files go into a directory "netinclude" which has to sit in the same directory as
the source code and the "include" directory you find in there. I'm not currently
supplying these header files here. Drop me a line, and I'll take care of that.

The SAS/C flavour (smakefile) should get the library built using the "large data"
model. This rules out the use of residentable programs as the startup code I'm
using is very primitive (startup.o) and doesn't tinker with A4 relative data
addressing (and how this may be set up).

There are two makefiles for GCC, each a different flavour. There is "GNUmakefile.68k",
which will build the library for GCC on the 68k platform ("classic" Amiga). This
builds all variants of the library, for large data, small data, resident, whatever
model. It's a lot of work and I don't recommend you do this on a plain 68k machine.
It will literally (!) take hours. The other makefile flavour is for AmigaOS4 using
the PowerPC hosted GCC system ("GNUmakefile.os4"). This builds only the large data
version of the library, but this is usually all you need. Small data support is
currently not implemented but might follow in the future.
